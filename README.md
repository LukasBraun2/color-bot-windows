Requires Conquest RSPS to be installed and running before program is running.
Currently only works on blue lizards at lizardman dungeon.
Get Conquest RSPS here: https://conquest.ps/play
Shouldn't matter whether jar or exe. Open the Conquest launcher once
downloaded, click play, log in (you can create an account by simply logging
in with the username and password you desire - REMEMBER PASSWORD entered).
open the symbol that looks like a world map, go to the monsters tab, click
on lizardmen and click teleport.

That's everything, now just click readPix.exe to run the bot.

NOTE: 
-Conquest will have to be the top window at all times. 
-This bot only kills blue lizardmen at the moment.
-You will have to exit the command line window that opens up in order for
program to stop.
